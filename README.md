# Starfighter
This little game started by following the Gosu tutorial and branched off to my own thing.
I added the meteors and the lives functions, so that the game ends when a player
runs out of lives or scores 1000 points.

I plan on adding a timer and keep score on who has the fastest times and adding
a difficulty selector by adding more meteors to avoid.  I would also like to create my own
graphics for this game, but that will come after all the functionality is done.

To run this game just gem install gosu and clone this repo.
Run ruby window.rb once you cd into the main folder.
